                <p> I am currently taking a gap semester to learn web dev / design and become a better

                    join in on research so I can apply the skills I have learned through my
                    classes.</p>

                <h2>Personal Goals</h2>
                <p>This semester my personal goal is to apply my technical skills
                    as much as possible. This is why I am self-learning web developement and 
                    web design through the help of decals. I am also actively searching 
                    for internships and finally becomming part of the recruiting process. 
                    I am also dedicating more time to dance, in DanceWorx and AFX and am
                    getting to learn from amazing people. I will be revisiting this website 
                    to redesign, but for now I am happy I was able to get it done.
